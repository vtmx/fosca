Theme Name: Fosca World
Description: Born from a Venetian mother and a Dutch father, Fosca enters adulthood with the enthusiasm of a twenty-something looking for answers to existential questions through the creation of a fantastic universe filled with curious anthropomorphic animals. These creatures seem to find their roots in the apocalyptic menace of certain Flemish paintings, tempered by the lightheartedness and refinement of an XVIII century Venetian carnival.
